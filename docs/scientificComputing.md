Lab members who want to work independently with their data need to be comfortable working with the unix command line and be able to at least understand shell scripts written in bash. In less than ten hours the initial training can be completed through three Lynda.com courses. New Lynda.com members can sign-up for a free 10-day trail, and if more time is needed there is a $35 month-to-month rate available. The three courses are:

1) 6 h 35 min: The basics of unix, linux, and unix-like systems. Go to lynda.com and search for the course titled "Unix for Mac OS X Users". The course title is a bit of a misnomer: it is suitable even for users who do not currently use Mac OS X, and the material is relevant for our linux-based servers and workstations.

2) 57 min: Users need to be comfortable with a text editor that doesn't require a graphical user interface because sometimes text files and scripts will be edited within an ssh session. Users who touch-type will want to learn to the text editor named vim (nee vi). Search lynda.com for the course titled "Up and running with VI". For users who don't touch-type, or for whom the the vim learning curve too steep, a less powerful editor called nano could be substituted for vim (search lynda.com for "up and running with nano", which is 33 minutes).

3) 1 h, 25 min: Bash scripting will allow you to take what you learned about using the command line in the first course and extend that knowledge to write/edit/debug scripts. Search lynda.com for the course titled "up and running with bash scripting"
